Hello! My name is Matt. If you're reading this, then it means you want to know more about me. Why do you want to know more about me? Probably because, like me, you realize that
everyone in the world is a unique individual with their own story. There can be a lot to learn from everyone you meet, as long as you are open to it.

I have had many different careers in my life. At the time of writing this, I am about to turn 40. I've spent the last 7 years of my life working as a project manager in the
construction industry. Before this I have been a private music teacher, school teacher, truck driver, musician, and audio engineer. But let me tell you something. I've always
wanted to work with computers, and always had an interest in programming. Maybe it was growing up watching movies like Hackers, or Wargames, or even Jurassic Park. Remember
Nedry? It might be weird, but I kinda wanted to be that guy. Well, minus the whole jeapordizing everyones lives to steal dinosaur embryos only to be killed by a Dilophosaurus.
Anyway, during high school thats what I wanted to do. I took the computer courses, and I did well with them. I took the math courses, and I struggled. So in the end, my guidance
councellor told me to forget about computers and focus on what I was good at. The only other thing I was good at was music. We all know how well music pays the bills.

So now here I am. 22 years after high school, 2 university degrees, one college diploma, and being miserable in a job I hate. It's time to go back to my interests. It's time
to learn to code. So here I am.
